        <p>Beeb and Cheeb began their journey the night of February 28<sup>th</sup>, 2025 at the 
        Beacon Hill establishment, Roxanne's. They had an amazing first date that was filled with laughter, 
    thoughtful questions, and talk of their favorite TV show (scrubs). The night ended with Sam beating Bridget 
    at Gin Rummy at the Sevens, and perhaps a smooch outside of the redline train station. When Beeb and Cheeb left that night, they
    both had a feeling that they were looking at something very, very special. </p>

        As late winter transitioned to spring, Bridget and Sam had the best of times. They tore it up at the
        H Street St. Patrick's Day party, where they had a fantastic first photograph together:

        After that epic St. Patrick's day banger, Sam knew that this girl was a keeper. After a wonderful dinner
        in Tibet (or something like that), and a few too many Guinness at the Burren, Sam officially asked Bridget
        to be his girlfriend.

        Their adventures continued as they officially began their relationship together, with
        going to Prom with Matt, long saturday runs, trips to see the ballad of Wallis Island, and so much more!

        Now, at this point, Bridget and Sam were madly in love with each other. Sam remembers distinctly sending 
        a Kurt Vonnegut quote that described love as "little gifts" and being nervous because he hadn't told Bridget
        he loves her yet.

        The L word was finally said the night that Bridget finished her last class of Law School. The couple had just 
        finished an epic night at Anchovies with Bridget's siblings and her SOs, when they were walking back to Bridget's 
        apartment via Salem Street. Bridget was the first one to say it, but they both had such an intense love for each 
        other they were just so happy to hear it out loud!

        What better way to conclude the early adventures and celebrate love by climbing Mt. Washington. Beeb 
        and Cheeb had an epic day of hiking talking about whatever came to their mind and falling in snow!
        (Maybe that was just Sam)
